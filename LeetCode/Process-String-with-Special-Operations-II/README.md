# Process String with Special Operations II

Can you solve this real interview question? Process String with Special Operations II - You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters and the special characters: '*', '#', and '%'.

You are also given an integer k.

Build a new string result by processing s according to the following rules from left to right:

 * If the letter is a lowercase English letter append it to result.
 * A '*' removes the last character from result, if it exists.
 * A '#' duplicates the current result and appends it to itself.
 * A '%' reverses the current result.

Return the kth character of the final string result. If k is out of the bounds of result, return '.'.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "a#b%*", k = 1

Output: "a"

Explanation:

i s[i] Operation Current result 0 'a' Append 'a' "a" 1 '#' Duplicate result "aa" 2 'b' Append 'b' "aab" 3 '%' Reverse result "baa" 4 '*' Remove the last character "ba"

The final result is "ba". The character at index k = 1 is 'a'.

Example 2:

Input: s = "cd%#*#", k = 3

Output: "d"

Explanation:

i s[i] Operation Current result 0 'c' Append 'c' "c" 1 'd' Append 'd' "cd" 2 '%' Reverse result "dc" 3 '#' Duplicate result "dcdc" 4 '*' Remove the last character "dcd" 5 '#' Duplicate result "dcddcd"

The final result is "dcddcd". The character at index k = 3 is 'd'.

Example 3:

Input: s = "z*#", k = 0

Output: "."

Explanation:

i s[i] Operation Current result 0 'z' Append 'z' "z" 1 '*' Remove the last character "" 2 '#' Duplicate the string ""

The final result is "". Since index k = 0 is out of bounds, the output is '.'.
