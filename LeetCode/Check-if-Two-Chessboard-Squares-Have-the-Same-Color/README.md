Return true if these two squares have the same color and false otherwise.

The coordinate will always represent a valid chessboard square. The coordinate will always have the letter first (indicating its column), and the number second (indicating its row).

 

Example 1:

Input: coordinate1 = "a1", coordinate2 = "c3"

Output: true

Explanation:

Both squares are black.

Example 2:

Input: coordinate1 = "a1", coordinate2 = "h3"

Output: false

Explanation:

Square "a1" is black and "h3" is white.
