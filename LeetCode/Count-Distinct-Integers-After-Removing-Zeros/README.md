# Count Distinct Integers After Removing Zeros

Can you solve this real interview question? Count Distinct Integers After Removing Zeros - You are given a positive integer n.

For every integer x from 1 to n, we write down the integer obtained by removing all zeros from the decimal representation of x.

Return an integer denoting the number of distinct integers written down.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10

Output: 9

Explanation:

The integers we wrote down are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1. There are 9 distinct integers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).

Example 2:

Input: n = 3

Output: 3

Explanation:

The integers we wrote down are 1, 2, 3. There are 3 distinct integers (1, 2, 3).
