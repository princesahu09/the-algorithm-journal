# Handling Sum Queries After Update

Can you solve this real interview question? Handling Sum Queries After Update - You are given two 0-indexed arrays nums1 and nums2 and a 2D array queries of queries. There are three types of queries:

 1. For a query of type 1, queries[i] = [1, l, r]. Flip the values from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0 in nums1 from index l to index r. Both l and r are 0-indexed.
 2. For a query of type 2, queries[i] = [2, p, 0]. For every index 0 <= i < n, set nums2[i] = nums2[i] + nums1[i] * p.
 3. For a query of type 3, queries[i] = [3, 0, 0]. Find the sum of the elements in nums2.

Return an array containing all the answers to the third type queries.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums1 = [1,0,1], nums2 = [0,0,0], queries = [[1,1,1],[2,1,0],[3,0,0]]
Output: [3]
Explanation: After the first query nums1 becomes [1,1,1]. After the second query, nums2 becomes [1,1,1], so the answer to the third query is 3. Thus, [3] is returned.


Example 2:


Input: nums1 = [1], nums2 = [5], queries = [[2,0,0],[3,0,0]]
Output: [5]
Explanation: After the first query, nums2 remains [5], so the answer to the second query is 5. Thus, [5] is returned.
